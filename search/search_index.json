Placeholder types # There are different types of placeholders: System-defined ones: {HOME} - the user's home directory {CWD} - the current working directory {TMP} - the temporary directory Input-based ones, which are based on the current input file being processed: {INPUT_PATH} - the directory component of the current file {INPUT_NAMEEXT} - the name (incl ext) of the current file {INPUT_NAMENOEXT} - the name (excl ext) of the current file {INPUT_EXT} - the extension of the current file {INPUT_PARENT_PATH} - the path of the file's parent {INPUT_PARENT_NAME} - the name of the file's parent User-defined ones, which are supplied to the tool itself, e.g., via the -p/--placeholders option of the sdc-convert tool. The same script can be executed using different directories when using different placeholder setups. The format for the placeholders files is simple, one placeholder per line using placeholder=value as format. Empty lines and ones starting with # get ignored. Runtime ones, which can be set with the set-placeholder plugin. These placeholders can be based on other placeholders. The reason for this plugin is that the output of some filters may not have any directory associated with them anymore, only a file name. That renders all the input-based placeholders unusable. Using set-placeholder beforehand allows saving the input directory in another placeholder for later use. Meta-data can be used as placeholders as well using the metadata-to-placeholder plugin, which extracts a particular key from the metadata passing through and updates the specified placeholder accordingly.
