The [spectral-data-converter](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/spectral-data-converter) 
library (and its dependent libraries) can be used for converting **spectral data** from one format 
into another.

Please refer to the [dataset formats](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/spectral-data-converter?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset-formats)
section for more details on supported formats.

But the library does not just convert data formats, you can also slot in complex filter pipelines to 
process/clean the data.

On this website you can find examples for:

* [Filter usage](filters.md)
* [Placeholders](placeholders.md)
* [Python functions](pyfunc.md)
* [Docker usage](docker.md)
* [ZIP files](zip.md)
* [Direct I/O](directio.md)

Examples for the additional libraries:

* [scikit-learn](sklearn.md)
* [Visualization](vis.md)
